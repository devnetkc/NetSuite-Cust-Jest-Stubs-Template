# Introduction

This project is meant to serve as a baseline template project for getting tests implemented easier in to your NetSuite projects. Use these stubs for modules which are imported to other NetSuite SuiteCloud projects.

Using the directory path `/SuiteScript/...`, we can provide aliases locally for these modules while still being available in NetSuite -- as the root directory for SuiteScript files in NetSuite is `/SuiteScripts/`.

## 🎉 Getting Started

1. Open [`./package.json`](./package.json) and customize the project configuration
2. Run `npm i` to install project dependencies
3. Add your module path aliases to [`customJestStubs.js`](./customJestStubs.js)
4. Create a local environment variable `NPM_TOKEN` using your NPM token for the value
5. Publish your npm package using `npm publish`

## 🧐 Notable Files

- [`README.hbs`](./.ci/templates/README.hbs) -- Base template file the project README.md is generated from
- [`npmrc`](./.npmrc) -- NPM environment token loader file for publishing project
- [`docsMD.config`](./.ci/config/docsMD.config.js) -- Wiki MD generator from JSDoc notations
- [`jsDocsConf.json`](./.ci/config/jsDocsConf.json) -- JSDocs configuration file

## 🔨 Scripts

Use `npm run <script>` to execute various commands for the project

- `npm run docs` -- Generates project documentation based on JSDoc notations (Configure with [docsMD.config](./.ci/config/docsMD.config.js) && [jsDocsConf.json](./.ci/config/jsDocsConf.json))
- `npm run open-docs` -- Opens documentation in browser for viewing

## 👷 CI/CD

Azure yaml pipeline files are provided in [`.ci/workflows`](./.ci/workflows).

- [`azure-pipelines-docs.yml`](./.ci/workflows/azure-pipelines-docs.yml) -- Generates documentation, commits,and pushes back to current PR/branch
